                    <h5>Shipping & Handling Time</h5>
                    <p>
                        Orders are usually processed within 12 to 15 business days (Monday â€“ Saturday). Customised
                        jewelry
                        takes 12-15 working days as it is 100% handcrafted and crafted with the finest finish. Some
                        orders,
                        such as pre-order items, may take longer. In case of unforeseen delays, we will notify you
                        immediately.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Shipping Charges</h5>
                    <p>
                        We offer <strong>FREE SHIPPING</strong> across India.

                    <h5>Shipment Tracking</h5>
                    <p>
                        Once your order is shipped, you will receive a notification with the shipment tracking number to
                        track your order.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Delivery Location</h5>
                    <p>
                        Orders can only be delivered to the recipient's residential or work location. Delivery to public
                        places such as malls, hotels, restaurants, hostels, or streets is not permitted. If the
                        recipient is
                        unavailable during delivery, the courier company will attempt to deliver the product up to three
                        times. If delivery is still unsuccessful, the package will be returned to our facility in
                        Kolkata.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Change in Shipping Address</h5>
                    <p>
                        Shipping details cannot be changed by customers once the order is created. However, if you wish
                        to
                        change the shipping address, please send an email to <a
                            href="mailto:help@jagdambajewellers.com">help@jagdambajewellers.com</a> with your request.
                        Ensure that the details provided are accurate to avoid non-delivery.
                    </p>

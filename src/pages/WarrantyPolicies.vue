                        <li>Damage or breakage when the jewelry is not in our possession.</li>

                    <h5>Tips for General Jewelry Care</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wipe your jewelry regularly to keep it clean and free of dirt.</li>
                        <li>Do not polish plated jewelry items.</li>
                        <li>Avoid storing jewelry near heating vents, windowsills, or in the car.</li>
                        <li>When not wearing, place each piece in a cloth pouch, box, or wrap in tissue paper to prevent
                            scratches. Let chains dangle to avoid tangles and knots.</li>
                        <li>For plated jewelry made with sterling silver and an 18k gold coating, lightly wipe with a
                            cotton
                            cleaning cloth.</li>
                        <li>Avoid contact with perfumes, deodorants, detergents, oils, nail polish, nail polish remover,
                            and
                            chlorine, as these substances may react with the jewelry and cause tarnishing.</li>
